# Stock X - Predicting the resell value of sneakers

In this notebook, I will perform regression to predict the price of a given sneaker based on several factors such as order date, brand, sneaker name, sale price, and several others. 

The dataset has been publicly released by StockX during their Data Contest which took place in 2019. It can be accessed here: https://stockx.com/news/the-2019-data-contest/.


From StockX: *"The data we’re giving you consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017 (the month that Off-White first debuted “The Ten” collection) and the present. There are 99,956 total sales in the data set; 27,794 Off-White sales, and 72,162 Yeezy sales. The sample consists of U.S. sales only."

In this project, I use several regression models to predict the price of a sneaker based on multiple factors. 
These factors include:
* Sneaker Name
* Sale Price
* Brand
* Order Date
* Region
